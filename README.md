## Manage AWS VPC as Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
This code creates AWS VPC resources, making a VPC in each of a regions and then two subnets in each VPC in three different availability zones.

To use it, firstly we need to install Terraform, find the appropriate package for your system and download it:

## Create AWS IAM User
Terraform uses AWS REST API to manage AWS resources, so we need to setup a new user account and I'm assume you have it.
Copy to clipboard the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, then set them as envrionment variables by running the commands below:
```
aws configure
cd ~/.aws/
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
Or put it into the file ~/.aws/credentials like this:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
## Deploy
To deploy this VPC you need to execute:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
